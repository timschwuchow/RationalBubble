## Synopsis

ConsumerOnly.py is a module designed to solve and simulate data for a recursive rational expectations model of housing prices found in RationalBubbleTheory.pdf.  The data produced by these simulations were used to estimate the bias and standard errors of the OLS estimator on these simulated data (results found in MCEstimates.pdf).  Together, these results establish that OLS is not a suitable estimator for this model.
