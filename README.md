## Synopsis

ConsumerOnly.py is a module designed to solve and simulate data for a recursive rational expectations model of housing prices found in RationalBubbleTheory.pdf.  The data produced by these simulations were used to estimate the bias and standard errors of a structural Kalman filter based estimator on these simulated data (results found in MCEstimates.pdf).  Together, these results establish that a Kalman filter based estimator requires an error correction during estimation of actual data.
